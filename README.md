should probably note you can literally change the ordering of 8 numbers in this thing have it look 
like its doing something impressive, but really just bit flips the entire input regardless of password...

compressions still all in my head have a bad habit of not trusting anything
and im pretty sure the notes / code is a total cluster fuck

crypt.sh - default with out additions
random_crypt.sh - takes input against random key pick to increase password length
random_decrypt.sh - split of the above because debug
random_encrypt.sh - split of the above because debug
key_crypt.sh - attempt to add -k key to the entire thing...
going to write a bruteforce script to actually test how valid this entire thing is
sensible thing to do would be honeypot a couple of half finished scripts so google searches point people in the wrong direction
but it isnt hard to make a few tweaks to increase how computationally hard this will be to crack and i would rather know
