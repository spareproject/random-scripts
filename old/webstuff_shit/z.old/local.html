right so main problem would be defining nspawn containers and storage containers <br />
pretty easy to pump out some for loops for to load the template for every nspawn <br />
if im sticking containers in then itll need gpg stuff still have no idea how the fuck your suppose to tell it to use a sub key<br/>
so every button needs to hold hidden varialbes? cant really remember how i did it the last time but manually setting a load of vars in the button based on $i that gets send to start.cgi stop.cgi map.cgi etc<br /> 
needs a user set button on container.create to tell this thing that its either a mount or a vm might ? <br />
o and totally need an encrypted copy of template that i cant decrypt but can clone then add an extra key basically i want a script to make the template and that be it no editting archiso style updates an entierly new usb needs to be created dunno how to blag that yet tho the original would still allow extra keys to be added ? <br /> 
needs a script to edit the default locations for all this crap
